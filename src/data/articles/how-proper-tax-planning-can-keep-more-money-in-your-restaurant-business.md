Running a restaurant can be very fulfilling and challenging at the same time for many because of the fact that they are dealing with tax issues involved in every restaurant operation. Almost all of the uncertainties about tax regulations for restaurants are that a tax professional can provide the information needed to help restaurant owners turn the tables and start saving on taxes, thus enabling them to save more of their hard-earned earnings. A lot of restaurants have distinct tax challenges and opportunities which makes it all the more critical that you tap each and every available strategy to optimize the tax in your favor. Association with a knowledgeable professional in tax can make a real difference to the smoothness of your tax filing procedure through proper preparation, timely action and working together. At **[Ambit](https://www.ambitkpo.com/services/tax-services),** we specialize in helping restaurants keep their books and also to keep them in good order come tax time. Restaurant preparation for this tax season should look something like this.

## 1. Deduct the Full Value of Eligible Equipment and Improvements

Most restaurants invest in new equipment and physical improvements to meet the need to keep up with their consumers and industry standards. Generally, expenses of this nature can be written off as Section 179 depreciation accelerated.

* **Section 179 Deduction:** This authorizes taxpayers to write down the entire amount of the purchase price at the time its onset is to be applied relating to these qualifying assets subject to some limitation during the year of purchase. Qualifying property as applied in the tax law contains fixtures or equipment assigned to the enterprise.
* **Bonus Depreciation (Section 168):** Any property that you use for business purposes and that doesn't have a value attributable to pretax use would be fair game, as suggested in the tax law. 

When acquiring or repositioning a property, cost segregation studies can reclassify certain building components into shorter-lived depreciation categories, which in turn, provides for deductions sooner. A professional in tax planning from Ambit will help you analyze the timing of deductions and how they impact overall tax strategy.

## 2. Understand and Maximize Available Tax Credits

There are some tax credits that reduce your tax obligation directly, making them one of the most powerful tools that a restaurant owner can have in filing their taxes. Here are some of them:

* **FICA Tip Credit:** Restaurants must bear FICA taxes for reported tips. This credit provides some cost recovery to tips above the minimum wage ($5.15/hr under this credit), catapulting significant savings.
* **Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC):** Hire employees from target groups like veterans and long-term unemployed; there are usually huge credits with its paperwork. Restaurants hiring from these demographics can consistently see lower tax liabilities.

Consider giving K-1s to owners running on pass-through entities (like LLCs, S Corporations and partnerships) so that these shareholders can claim the QBI. This deduction could reduce taxable income by up to 20%, lowering the effective tax rates. 

This is what our highly qualified tax planning team at Ambit will guide you through—identifying and utilizing some of the best credits for saving much, as you prepare for the filing season.

## 3. Proper Worker Classification to Avoid Costly Penalties

Misclassification of employees and contractors is the most common problem in the restaurant sector, which results in audits and penalties. It is very important to have a proper classification for tax planning and compliance. See to it that you:

* Consider the employees subject to control in terms of work, i.e. time, tasks, and equipment usage.
* Apply the appropriate tax forms: W-2 for employees and 1099 for independent contractors. 

With the advice and assistance of the tax pros at Ambit, your records will be accurate, making losses next to impossible during the tax filing period. Here, you can get assistance on understanding the rules covering worker classification and maintaining compliance to prevent penalties.

## 4. Reserve for Quarterly Tax Payment

One of the things different from the usual to other industries happens in restaurants because they need to work on a slim margin with fluctuating profit. Not paying such intake would bring about fines, adding extra financial stress. Since your restaurant is organized as an S Corporation, LLC, or sole propriety, you have to work on planning to pay in advance.

Start creating an allotment from which part of your gains is set to go toward the payment. Ambit's team is on hand to assist you with tax projections to figure out the exact amounts and to further advise you on sound tax methods to solve the cash flow issues associated with seasonal peaks in your restaurants.

## 5. Deduct Current Expenses/Routine Repairs or Maintenance 

That involves capitalizing on a minor repair instead of expensing it. Consequently, the taxpayer will lose out on any potential deductions. The IRS Repair Regulations provide that:

* A company can expense routine maintenance and ordinary repairs that don't materially prolong the asset's life to the equipment or building. 
* Scrutinizing the maintenance expenses can prove beneficial in finding deductions that can help lower the overall tax liability.

At Ambit, we take a very deep-dive approach when looking at these tax saving opportunities for you. That is why you could maximize all savings pertinent to your tax filing.

## 6. Modify Your Business Structure for Long-term Tax Savings

The type of business entity you now have greatly impacts your taxes. The pros and cons of each type have to be kept in mind and also the structure needs amendment as follows: 

For example:

* C Corporations are double taxes.
* S Corporations save company owners from paying self-employment taxes by presenting a part of that income in the form of distributions rather than wages.
* Partnerships pass income through to partners and might allow for qualifying for QBI deductions.

If your restaurant is already on the road to expansion or set to undergo remodeling, make sure your entity selection continues to fulfill the needs of your evolving business by having a consultation with Ambit's expert tax planning team. 

## Why Start Tax Planning Now? 

The beginning of tax season may seem overwhelming, but early tax planning sets your restaurant up for success.
