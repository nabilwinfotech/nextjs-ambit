* **Social Security Number (SSN):** Invalid SSN for yourself. your spouse or those who are dependents This may cause delays in processing or even the return of unapproved merchandise.

## 2. Failing to Report All Income

People often think that not reporting all their income is the easiest way to reduce taxes but it is one of the major mistakes that leads to the penalties. The IRS receives copies of all your income documents like W-2s, 1099s or 1098s and if they do not match with what you report it can trigger an audit.

### How to Avoid This Error:

* **Gather all income-related documents:** Ensure you have everything such as W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, and any other forms that report your earnings.
* **Review bank statements:** Look for any additional sources of income that may not have been reported to you via a tax form.
* **Be honest:** While it might seem tempting to leave off a little income, the IRS already knows about it. So, it is better if you report everything upfront.

## 3. Missing Deductions and Credits

There are a lot of tax deductions and credits available that can reduce your taxable income or the amount of tax you owe. But taxpayers forget to claim them, leaving money on the table. A few examples of common deductions and credits include:

* Child Tax Credit
* Education credits
* Home office deductions (For freelancers and small business owners)
* Medical expense deductions

### How to Avoid This Error:

* **Maximize deductions and credits:** Make sure you're taking advantage of all available tax benefits. If you're unsure, consult with a tax professional who can help identify deductions you may qualify for.
* **Use tax software:** Many tax software programs automatically to enter eligible deductions and credits based on your situation.
* **Professional Guidance:** Tax professionals are great at identifying hidden savings you might miss.

## 4. Calculation Errors

Simple math errors are one of the easiest mistakes when filing taxes manually. Whether you’re adding up income, calculating deductions or figuring out your refund or tax owed, miscalculations can cause problems with your tax return.

### How to Avoid This Error:

* **Double-check your details:** If you're filing manually, make sure to review your calculations carefully.
* **Use tax software:** Tax software automatically performs calculations, reducing the chance of human error. If you're working with a tax professional, they will ensure all calculations are correct.

## 5. Late Filing or Missing Deadline

Filing your taxes late can result in penalties and interest. Many people mistakenly miss the tax filing deadline due to procrastination or confusion. The IRS requires tax returns to be filed by April 15th each year (unless the date falls on a weekend or holiday). If you file late without requesting an extension, you could face additional fees.

### How to Avoid This Error:

* **File early:** Filing your tax return early reduces the stress of last-minute preparations and allows you to receive your refund sooner.
* **Request an extension:** If you need more time to gather information, request an extension. This gives you an additional six months to file your return, though any taxes owed are still due on the original deadline.
